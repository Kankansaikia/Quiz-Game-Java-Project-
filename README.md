Java Mini Project

Java-based Quiz Application designed as an engaging platform for interactive knowledge assessment. Unlike traditional quiz applications, this project emphasizes both user engagement and adaptability through a structured multi-phase approach, including login authentication, comprehensive rules display, and timed question challenges. The application provides users with a smooth, multi-step experience starting from the login page, where users enter their name, leading them to a rule overview before beginning the quiz.
The quiz consists of 10 multiple-choice questions, each presented with a 15-second response limit to encourage rapid recall and decision-making. A unique 50-50 lifeline feature enhances user experience by eliminating two incorrect options, increasing the probability of correct responses. To ensure seamless functionality, the application employs Java Swing and AWT libraries, enabling a responsive and user-friendly graphical interface.
The system is evaluated for its usability and effectiveness in delivering a real-time quiz experience, with performance assessed through user feedback on responsiveness and engagement. Additionally, the application demonstrates the flexibility of Java in developing interactive desktop applications, showcasing how a straightforward interface can support a robust user experience. This project highlights the value of combining Java-based GUI components with user-centric design principles in educational tools.
